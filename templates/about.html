  <h1>About Micro-Scenarios</h1>
  <p>
    Micro-Scenarios was created for people who want to handle real conversations with more clarity and calm,
    but don’t always have a coach, mentor, or therapist on call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of long courses or dense books, we focus on short, realistic situations you can walk through in a few minutes.
    Over time, those small reps add up to a different way of responding in real life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our content is informed by research in communication, conflict resolution, and counseling skills, combined with real-world experience.
  </p>
